2. Things I learned & things I'm still confused about:
### Things I Learned About Git/GitHub
- **GitHub Flow:** I learned about the GitHub flow, a lightweight workflow that helps in managing changes and collaborating on projects without losing previous work.
- **Commit Messages:** The importance of clear and descriptive commit messages stood out as a way to document progress for myself and collaborators.
- **Repositories in Depth:** I now better understand how repositories include not just files but also a full history of changes, and how they can be organized and navigated through the GitHub dashboard.
- **Markdown on GitHub:** GitHubâ€™s flavor of Markdown is a simple way to add structure, style, and even fun elements like images or emojis to repositories and discussions.
- **Starring and Following:** Features like starring repositories and following users can help keep track of interesting projects and developers in the community.
- **Pull Requests and Reviews:** I learned how pull requests facilitate collaboration by allowing others to review changes before they are merged into the main branch.

### Things I Am Still Confused About
- **Resolving Merge Conflicts:** While I understand the concept, Iâ€™m unsure how to resolve conflicts effectively when merging branches.
- **Forks vs. Clones:** I need to clarify when to use a fork versus a clone, especially in collaborative and open-source projects.
- **Advanced GitHub Workflows:** Concepts like linking issues to pull requests, using project boards, and GitHub Actions seem powerful, but I donâ€™t fully understand how to implement them in practice.
-  **Markdown Styling:** While Iâ€™ve tried basic markdown, Iâ€™m not entirely comfortable using advanced features like tables or embedding images effectively.
